\gls{Blockchain} based distributed ledgers have taken the computing world by storm and the huge success of Bitcoin and other \glspl{Cryptocurrency} has sparked an academic interest over the \gls{DLT}. Unfortunately, Blockchain based DLTs also have major disadvantages which cannot be overlooked and hence extensive research towards alternatives for Blockchain based \gls{DLT}s is needed. One such alternative is the \gls{DAG} based \gls{DLT}. \\

\gls{DAG} based DLTs have gained prominence with the introduction of IOTA and the Tangle introduced in \cite{Tangle} outlined the possibility of having a DLT which can scale infitely, atleast in theory.

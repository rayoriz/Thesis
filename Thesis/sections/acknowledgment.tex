I would like to extend my sincere thanks to my advisor Pezhman Nasirifard for being the best advisor possible and helping me out with all the issues I faced. I would also like to express my gratitude for my supervisor Prof. Dr. Hans-Arno Jaconbsen for providing me an opportunity to write this thesis at his chair at TU Munich and for the constant inspiration.

I would also like to thank Alon Gal from the IOTA foundation for his valuable inputs in designing this simulator. Also I express my gratitude to Minh-Nghia Nguyen for his correspondence and input in implementation of the tip selection algorithms used in the simulator.

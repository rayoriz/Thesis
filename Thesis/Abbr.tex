}

\newglossaryentry{Cryptocurrency}{
	name={Cryptocurrency},
    description={ A cryptocurrency (or crypto currency) is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets},

\newglossaryentry{nonce}{
	name={nonce},
    description={In cryptography, a nonce is an arbitrary number that can only be used once. It is similar in spirit to a nonce word, hence the name. It is often a random or pseudo-random number issued in an authentication protocol to ensure that old communications cannot be reused in replay attacks},
}

\newglossaryentry{electron}{
	name={Electron},
    description={Electron (formerly known as Atom Shell) is an open-source framework created by Cheng Zhao, and now developed by GitHub. It allows for the development of desktop GUI applications using front and back end components originally developed for web applications: Node.js runtime for the backend and Chromium for the frontend},
